What is Wikka?
--------------
WikkaWiki (aka Wikka) is a flexible, standards-compliant and lightweight wiki engine written in PHP, which uses MySQL to store pages. Forked from WakkaWiki. Designed for speed, extensibility, and security. Released under the GPL license.

Installing Wikka
----------------
To install from Github, first clone the WikkaWki repository into a web-accessible directory. For example, if you were going to run it on your local Ubuntu system:

    cd /var/www
    github clone https://github.com/wikkawik/WikkaWiki.git 

Make sure the database you are going to use is created:

    mysql -uroot -p -e "CREATE DATABASE wikka"

From this point, you can use the web-based installer. Browse to:

    http://localhost/WikkaWiki

For more detailed installation instructions, see http://docs.wikkawiki.org/WikkaInstallation.
